package com.gang4.behavioral.mediator;
//ðŸš€ Decouples components â€“ Services donâ€™t depend on each other directly.
//ðŸš€ Centralized communication â€“ The Mediator handles message passing.
//ðŸš€ Easier maintenance â€“ Adding new services (e.g., Fraud Detection) doesnâ€™t require modifying existing services.
//ðŸš€ Improves scalability â€“ More services can be added without increasing dependencies.

//
//Description -
//        1. This design pattern is needed when we don't want to expose one functionality to end user. that's why we craete one mediator that interacts with the end user and finally communicates with the main system
