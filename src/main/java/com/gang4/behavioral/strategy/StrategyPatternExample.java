//âœ… When you have multiple ways to perform a task (loan interest calculation, payment processing, fraud detection, etc.).
//âœ… When you want to avoid if-else or switch-case statements for selecting an algorithm.
//âœ… When you need to dynamically change behaviors without modifying existing code.
//ðŸš€ Encapsulation of Algorithms â€“ Interest calculation logic is separated from the main processing logic.
//ðŸš€ Open-Closed Principle â€“ New loan types can be added without modifying existing code.
//ðŸš€ Runtime Behavior Change â€“ The loan type can be dynamically selected at runtime.
